# Mobile Development Repository

Dear viewer,

Welcome to my Mobile Development repository for Term 1, Year 3.

Please follow the folder structure and file naming conventions I have used for each assignment when reviewing my work.

## Folder Structure

**Example:**

- **W1 folder:** Contains all assignment files (EX-1.dart, EX-2.dart, EX-3.dart, EX-4.dart) and bonus exercises in the root directory.

- **W2 folder:** Contains two subfolders:
  - `assigenment/` - for submitting assignments (EX-1.dart, EX-2.dart, EX-3.dart, EX-4.dart, UML.md)
  - `class-work/` - for class exercises and practice code

- **W3 folder:** Contains two subfolders:
  - `assignement/` - for submitting assignments only
  - `class-work/` - for class exercises

Inside each folder, you will find files named according to the assignment, such as:
- `EX-1.dart` (for Exercise 1)
- `EX-2.dart` (for Exercise 2)
- And so on...

Thank you!
